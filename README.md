-   I would like the following formats (these are all PDF, but in the
    future, Iâ€™d like to learn how to create HTML and interactive
    versions):
    -   note: single-document, go-to format
    -   report: multi-document, looks very similar to a note
    -   book: multi-document, operates like a report but looks and feels
        like a book
    -   beamer: single-document presentation format
